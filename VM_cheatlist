Vagrant-Ubuntu-Trusty

inside the VM:
run: pwd (for current directory)
ls -al (to see all the hidden files and directories with additional 
info)

What some of the directories mean:

etc = configuration files live here
var = (variable files) = files expected to grow or change in size = 
system and application logs
bin = executable binaries accessible by all users
sbin = to be used only by root for system administration and maintenance 
purposes
lib = for libraries that support binaries
usr = for user programs (similar to bin, but in bin are required for 
boot-up and system maintenance processes)

SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

to be aware of all the new updates (but does not install them):
sudo apt-get update

to actually do the upgrade:
sudo apt-get upgrade

to see the apt-get manual:
man apt-get

autoremove = checks if some packages are no longer used and removes them
to install that:

sudo apt-get autoremove

to search the names of packages: packages.ubuntu.com
